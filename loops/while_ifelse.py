'''
Here is another example showing a boolean variable being used to control the loop.
This is very common with while loops. In this case, the boolean variable is named Invalid.
Invalid is initially set to be True. The code within the loop is executed until Invalid is set to False. This is a good method for validating any input that needs to be within a certain range.
'''

invalid = True

while invalid:
    number = int(input("Please enter a number in the range 10 to 20: "))
    if number >= 10 and number <= 20:
        invalid = False
    else:
        print("Sorry number must be between 10 and 20")
        print("Please try again")

else:
    print("You entered {0}".format(number))
    print("This is a valid number")
